# Linear_Regression_project

### Project is from the Udemy course: 2022 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass
-----------  

## Purpose of Project  
This is a capstone project that uses all the skills learned up to this point in the course.  
The project analyzes a data set from: Ames Housing Data
The project goes through the process of cleaning and organizing the data. Exploring the data. Scale the data.  
Using a portion of the data to train a regression model. Checking the performance of the model.  
Uses a grid search to optimize the model parameters.  
Then evaluating the model performance using mean absolute error and root mean squared error.  
The end goal is to have a model that can efficiently predict the sale price of a home.

## Program version  
- Python version 3.9.12  
- Jupyter Notebook version 6.4.8  
- Visual Studio version 1.73.1  

## Skills  
- Read in data using pandas  
- Explore data set using pandas  
- Create visuals using Seaborn and matplotlib    
- Create a Elastic Net linear regression model through scikit-learn  
- Optimize parameters though using GridSearchCV from scikit-learn  
- Model performance evaluation using MAE and RMSE from scikit-learn metrics    

## Improvements  
I need to go through the project and try adjusting other parameters to see if I can improve the efficiency of the model.  
It may be good to reduce the lines by removing some redundancy of coding, e.g. looking at the data set after doing some filtering of the data frame. I may need to include more explanation of the code. 

## Comments  
I chose to include this exercise in my portfolio because it demonstrates the skills to organize data and use of the machine learning trees methods.  
I found the course to be very valuable in learning the techniques through hands-on exercises!
